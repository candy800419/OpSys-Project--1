Files Attached
--------------------------------------
main.cpp
classSim.h
main2.cpp
classSim2.h


main.cpp & main2.cpp both output to output.txt in order to view all the output from the files since the terminal could not print enough lines. 

If you wish to use one specific algorithm over another type the algorithm 
next to the name of the program the algorithms are: 

fcfs
sjf
psjf
pp
rr

fcfs for first come first serve
sjf for shortest job first 
psjf for shortest job first with preemption 
pp for preemptive piority 
rr for round robin

the code will run just fine without this option but it is helpful if you wish to use one specific function over another. 



Part 1: 
--------------------------------------
main.cpp & classSim.h 

For all algorithms (fcfs, sjf, psjf, pp, and rr) the file:
Prints when a process is create 
Prints when the process accesses the CPU for the first time
Prints when the process has a context switch (with 8ms taken into account) 
Prints when the process terminates 

When those prints are done for each function the program: 
Prints minimum, average, and maximum turn around times 
Prints minimum, average, and maximum initial wait times
Prints minimum, average, and maximum total wait times 

All to three decimal places



Part 2: 
--------------------------------------
main2.cpp & classSim2.h
